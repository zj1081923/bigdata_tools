“MongoDB is the NoSQL leader and getting better”
Overall: The first decision about whether to use MongoDB or not is whether you need a relational or non-relational DB. Once you decide a non-relational is best for you project, then MongoDB is a solid choice. It has the ongoing support of a professional team and is widely used in the market, especially for projects utilizing the MEAN stack. This makes it easier to deploy than other solutions.
Pros: MongoDB is incredibly easy to set up and use. The fact that non-relational DBs are better for more unstructured data, makes it so that you don't necessarily have to know exactly what the end state is going to be before building your schema. Its data throughput is also a key differentiator, so anything with Big Data is going to be a good fit for a non-relational DB and MongoDB, in particular. Finally, the team behind MongoDB is constantly improving the product and releasing updates, and there are several good data viewers in the market, including one from Mongo, for viewing the data and creating queries.
Cons: Creating metrics dashboards can be challenging due to the potential need for JOIN queries in your data. Anything that contains these will be harder to aggregate. Their aggregation framework can be hard to use and limiting for certain requirements.
“Robust for scaling”
Overall: We switched from MLabs after MongoDB bought them and have since been able to make much better use of the MongoDB ecosystem with Compass, Charts, stronger cluster configuration etc.
Pros: We can see that MongoDB are on a growth-mindset, constantly adding new features like serverless functions, analytical text search, global write ops, and many other at-scale, enterprise level features. Some of these are already helping us reduce our infrastructure costs, for example, we've recently began switching off our third-party search service that was costing us £££ thanks to the introduction of MongoDB search.
Cons: We've had some recent headaches around the MongoDB connection string changes and issues with whitelisting some of our private VPNs on AWS. But these are minor issues. I personally think the Performance Advisor feature is poor - it would be far better to get a list of all unindexed queries listed by overall usage by time-period, rather than the adhoc suggestions that we see.
“Mongo allows you to take off easily, but makes it harder to do more advanced analysis.”
Pros: -Easy Setup -Getting simple data in/out is painless & straightforward -Basic analytics are easy, as is managing multi-server clusters
Cons: -Working with complex data is a difficult. -Many original features or design choices were incorrect and slow to be corrected. For example, timezone support is minimal and days/dates/months use a custom numbering rather than ISO. Mongo is only now adding ISO versions of aggregation commands
“Best NoSql database out there”
Overall: It's a great database and best to learn for someone entering the database world.
Pros: It's ease of use and integration with Python is the best thing. Use for web development and other applications, this has been a great tool.
Cons: Don't know the cons of this great product. I can say it would be better if they start providing certifications for professionals.
“Review of MongoDB”
Overall: I'm using mongoDB for more than two years and It was great selection when I need to store documents which has unknown structure along with shared structures. That means, it's very easy to save a JSON in mongoDB. This is very helpful when creating embedded databases for java microservices projects using spring boot by adding dependencies via start.spring.io
Pros: MongoDB is a schema less database management system and it has a document based structure and can store collection values on documents. It is extremely faster than the relational database management systems and it is a light weight reliable application. And It is very easy to scale while the product is open sourced which is free of charge.
Cons: Database joins are not supported since this is a No-sql database.
Overall: The experience is very good in working with MongoDB.
Pros: MongoDB supports range queries and regular expression searches which is very helpful for the user. It provides high availability with replica sets.
Cons: The security features of the software can be enhanced as the default security configuration provides full access to any user.
“It excels at what it does... as long as you understand what that is”
Overall: There are a lot of non-relational database options out there. These bring a ton of different advantages/disadvantages to the table. It really does feel like most alternatives are offering only part of the MongoDB feature-set. With major cloud providers now offering MongoDB as a managed service, this is a huge victory for them since management is the biggest downside to the product.
Pros: Mongo sets the bar for features when it comes to non-relational databases. From clustering to full-text indexing to geospatial indexes, its extremely hard to beat what MongoDB offers. It's easy to use from a developer perspective and easy to load and query data.
Cons: The operations side of Mongo can be a completely different story. It's really hard to configure clusters and even harder to recover from failures. The payoff is worth it because the feature-set is second to none.
“Good database management software”
Overall: It is a good database handling software because it provides an online version of mongodb called MongoDb Atlas where I can create my database on cloud platform(AWS, Google Cloud and Azure).
Pros: This works finely with node js because it handles json-like documents very well.Also as it is a cross-platform database, I can use from any platform. As it uses schema, it is easy for the users to create the databases.
Cons: data normalizing is not in mongo db. So abundance of data can be occur, In querying, join operation is not supported.
“Stellar DB solution-Easy to learn!”
Overall: MongoDB has been the perfect solution for the MillerEC. I've loved learning to use it and look forward to deploying projects with it in the future.
Pros: - incredibly easy to learn and integrate into code - fantastic support and built out systems for different languages (Nodejs, for example) - fast - the free version is all I have ever needed. It rocks
Cons: - it lives on its on servers. That's usually great, but makes testing difficult at times and does not feel as proprietary as one's own SQL servers.
“MongoDB - a modern approach to databases”
Overall: Overall, my experience with MongoDB has been positive and it has helped my company build databases fast and intuitively. It's easy to scale and works great.
Pros: Something that's really neat that MongoDB does that other database software doesn't do is database analytics. With data visualizations, I can build quick models to showcase my data in a meaningful way. I think that's just awesome.
Cons: I do have to say the data sizes on MongoDB is higher than what I've seen from other database software. There is also some lack of flexibility with querying because there are no JOINS.
“Amazingly Flexible Database Capability”
Pros: I don't usually rave about products, but I do about MongoDB. * MongoDB's schemaless document-centric approach to database makes it easy to store any kind of data I need to, even subdocuments and array fields with minimal fuss within code or tools. This allows for a lot of flexibility and makes it easy to upgrade or refactor existing software. * MongoDB's indexes provide amazing performance even in a schemaless world. Simple and compound indexes, as found in the relational database world, are just the start. Add to that multikey indexes (indexes over array fields), string and geolocation indexes, and indexes where entries expire documents with time. Mongo has it all. * MongoDB's approach to scalability - using replica sets for high availability and fault-tolerant failover and sharding databases over a potentially large number of servers - makes it easy to scale huge amounts of data without overly expensive hardware and failover complexity. * MongoDB driver support is available for a variety of languages. * Mongo University, free graded courses covering various aspects of MongoDB from development to administrative activities to security, etc., offers a solid path to learning.
Cons: I'm a huge proponent of MongoDB but because of the nature of schemaless document-oriented databases, there are still some problems for which a relational database is still the answer. There are some applications and technical domains where relational databases still have a huge lead over Mongo for performance.
“Best No-SQL Database.”
Overall: MongoDB has no proper structure like rows and columns in RDBMS. There is a feature called indexing where each and every row in the MongoDB database is identified with a unique id. The unique id is provided for each and every new document. The queries are easily understandable without involving any complex joins, unions. It also obeys the Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability known as ACID properties which are essential for a database. MongoDB supports sharding means huge data can be divided into smaller data and can be stored in multiple databases across a network. Different collections in MongoDB can be clubbed together and it also supports transactions which involve data needed from multiple documents across a collection. Based on these properties I have worked on different use cases and because of these features, work became simpler.
Pros: 1) There is no fixed schema like RDBMS. We can alter the table structure insert any number of rows and columns. 2) Data retrieving from this No-SQL database is very much fast when compared to other No-SQL databases. 3) Very easy to install. Provides JSON data support. 4) Can be integrated into different languages like Java, PHP. 5) There are no complex joins of queries like RDBMS. 6) The technical support can be available from MongoDB clients in case of any complex issues that occur while working. 7) Having extra features like a backup of stored data, sharing the data to multiple systems across the network is an added advantage. 8) Handles unstructured data i.e the data which has no format, no proper structure.
Cons: I did not find any flaws with this software.
Overall: According to my experience with MongoDB it is good NoSQL database. It has good query capacity, Also when we going to solve some business problems some requirements are change when we build the system. At that time we have to change same database collections. MongoDB support it.
Pros: Mongo DB is non relational database (NoSQL). It is a document database. it has good query capacity. Very easy to install and setup Mongo DB. Also Mongo DB is schema-free, there fore our software (code) defines the schema. It support BSON data format, there fore no complex to write code with mongo db (most of programming languages support BSON data format. We can index the mongo collections and increase the query performance
Cons: When we need to query using two mongo collections (join two collection), we can use lookup feature. but the problem is Mongo DB lookup feature is slow. Also we have no option to run query among two or three collections like as Elastic Search. When we using Elastic Search we can run query among two or three indexes(collections). There for in Elastic Search we can move historical data to separate collections and improve query performance. if we need query with historical, Elastic Search support it. But using Mongo DB we have to handle it in programming side.“Fastest leap In database management”
Overall: I use mongo with our applications. For any set of data, this is the best database.
Pros: Really speedy and requires less memory. We can create collections without a definite number of rows and columns to come. We can add data without restrictions It gives a JSON output which is really easy to work with Easy to add , edit and remove data If a certain section has more than one data, we can insert them as sub arrays, and it makes the developments so flexible.
Cons: The free version allows limited memory so that we have to upgrade it to insert unlimited data. Other than that this is the best. “One of the best NoSQL alternatives to traditional row/column RDBMSs”
Overall: While my company uses the Microsoft stack (.NET/IIS/SQL Server) for our enterprise development, we use a MERN (MongoDb, Express.js, React and Node.js) stack for most of our internal development (Intranet, sales reporting, ETL, automation, etc.). MongoDb is a key part of the flexibility of this stack, allowing us to model dynamic and complex data very quickly -- a huge advantage working in an agile development environment with short dev cycles and heavy reliance on iteration/refactoring.
Pros: Being a NoSQL, document-based database, MongoDb allows me to think about data NOT in terms of rows, columns, tables and keys, but in terms of complex hierarchical JSON-like documents that very closely resemble how the data is presented and used. This is incredibly valuable when quickly stubbing out a new app's feature set and the data requirements for it, with the added advantage that MongoDb works seemlessly within a MEAN/MERN development framework. Also, the learning curve is greatly shortened by MongoDb University, which is a free set of training courses taught by MongoDb, Inc., Engineers. It's an amazing free resource for the neophyte Mongo developer.
Cons: Because MongoDb doesn't have a schema, deeply nested objects can become needlessly complex if the developer doesn't have a strong understanding of hit/her data. Queries requiring joins of complex object structures can be slow in non-optimized, under-powered environments. “Powerful data base that allows high performance, continuous growth and high availability in storage”
Overall: When working with this database, the expansion became easier and much more economical than the relational data base due to the horizontal scaling, distributing the load across all the nodes, which allowed the organization to store many more data and perform queries. manufacturing very quickly
Pros: Queries can be made quickly because the data is connected and interlaced thanks to the ID that is given to each document, the search is simpler; in addition, it has the facility to balance the loads which allows a better storage of files, it does not have to pay for the license, it contains a high security with advanced user management, the semi-structured or structured databases can be easily adapted, you can program the tasks, you have tools for the analysis of the data, using this data base the neck of bottles generated in the relational databases is completely eliminated
Cons: When running mongoldb uses all the free RAM which works as the cache, when the amount of data exceeds 100GB it usually has performance problems, when making a copy the verification and the durability is committed, when making a writing on the base of data the same is blocked which drastically reduces the concurrence “A tool that fits very certain needs”
Pros: Certain common operations are very very easy to spin up a one-off query for and utilize the data right then and there. In that sense, there is a very lightweight feel to developing with MongoDB at the start of most projects.
Cons: The design paradigms around MongoDB make it so that you will eventually want to add some sort of schema-type check somewhere in your stack. This will make development much simpler over time as the data begins to evolve. In general, there's a lot of other scaffolding you will want to do in order to sane-ly use a NoSQL as most people seem to want to (a quick start data store for a project that would otherwise benefit from a relational database). Not saying this is the "correct way" to use MongoDB, but just our experience within a system/framework like Meteor for example. “A great not-too-NoSQL database”
Overall: I personally used it in project since the day it came out, and honestly some things were really bad, but the biggest barrier was in my teammates head as they rejected the innovation it represented at the time.
Pros: MongoDB has been a great product from the start as it brought the simplicity of the NoSQL movement against the old SQL/RDBMs "monsters", but also bringing a host of functionality that made it possible to use it immediately and without too much work in respect of the old RDBMs mindset and feature set. Setting it up even in a complex environment remains relatively easy, and also using it it's quite straightforward for developers. 3rd-party libraries and framework support is constantly increasing as well.
Cons: It has a history of bugs and weird things that made it look bad to some people.“Within the NoSQL databases, probably one of the best”
Overall: Count on NoSQL database technology, with a free but very useful technology, perfect for handling large amounts of data, making better use of the hardware resources of the applications that require it.
Pros: This type of non-relational database is a very useful tool today, where the amount of data handled in the web services are very abundant and a better way to store and take advantage of resources is needed, we use mongoDb, with its noSQL proposal takes better advantage of resources, since no paid licenses are needed, this money is used for hardware power, the expansion is easier since the database should not be restructured, it will keep the files linearly, that the escalation is horizontal and the load is distributed across all the nodes, taking better advantage of the hardware performance making any application more scalable.
Cons: It has its weaknesses, but you must know when to use this technology and when to use relational database, there are no transactions so if you need to use it, you should simulate them in a certain way, if it is very required in your application it is better to use sql, either Joins is available, so you should make several queries to interact between the data, you must be careful with this and know what technology is better with the application that will be developed.“The de facto standard for document-based NoSQL databases”
Overall: MongoDB has made it very easy to rapidly develop and deploy applications that require a document-store based NoSQL database solution.
Pros: MongoDB is the most widespread solution available in terms of a NoSQL database that manages data as a document store. It provides all the best features a NoSQL database should have to offer: clean and easy setup, simple syntax, as well as advanced features such as map-reduce and scaling capabilities. The BSON document type maps beautifully with the JavaScript stack, making it simple to wire up an application with a nodejs backend and any popular frontend JavaScript framework.
Cons: MongoDB can be hard to set up to support auto-scaling environments, and the best provisioned hosting options are quite expensive. “A database revolution”
Overall: For non-relational data storage, you really cannot beat MongoDB.
Pros: It's incredibly flexible and performant. With rich documents you can keep data in just about any way that makes sense to you. When your data doesn't nicely fit into the relational database format you'll want to use MongoDB. They're constantly developing the database and each version brings more features and better ways of doing things. The aggregation features allow for complex heavy queries to be run very quickly.
Cons: It can be a bit complicated to start with and writing aggregations without a great tool to help can be pretty tricky. Some of the features in the earlier versions are slightly limited and miss core requirements like 'join' style queries. “MongoDB is the best solution for NoSQL database.”
Overall: Overall MongoDB is the good choice for NoSQL database. It is basically document type database. It suits well in Javascript environment of NodeJS, Angular, React etc. where we can directly store and read objects from the framework. It is one of the component of MEAN stack.
Pros: Most of the features we can get it for free. It is very light weight and easy database. It has support with almost all popular programming languages. its performance is continuously improving with the newer versions. It is very easy to setup and use.
Cons: Sometimes it goes difficult to create JOIN like queries with MongoDB. They have provided the aggregation framework but it does not give ease and like SQL Join queries. It can crash in the production environment. “Database Schema”
Overall: I am a javascript developer and I always prefer to use MongoDB because it is very compatible with javascript world , I have setup many relations among the collections and it is very easy for overall web and mobile development.
Pros: 1. MongoDB is very compatible with javascript based technologies such as Node.js , Angularjs and Angular2+. 2. Import and Export Database is very easy. 3. MongoDB also IDE to manage Database collections. 4. Executing Database Schema is really easy. 5. Setting up relations in MongoDB is very easy as compared to traditional SQL based Databases.
Cons: You need to have a little bit knowledge of SQL and Database queries to understand the MongoDB concepts for managing DB and running its functions. “Best NoSQL database for light weight project”
Pros: I used MongoDb for my MEAN stack project which was a project management application.it is very easy to define datatypes and data fields in monodb with just a few line of codes.we actualy don't need to create data tables as in SQL.mongoDb will handle all that for us and another is with mongoDB there is no down times to update our databses because mongoDB will not requre script updates.that was very helpful in my roject because the application has to run all the time and collecting huge amount of data and also handling lot of concurrent users.so i think you need to try this mongoDb at least onece.
Cons: main cons whcich i was facing during my projects was there are no JOIN operations with mongoDb like in SQL.so i had to handle some application data retrivel process handle with whole dffertent qury.also i had some issues with concurent transation with my databse when application is in load test and performance testing levels. “First NOSQL based database as far I know and very efficient.”
Pros: Traditional databases was not supposed to deal with lots of data and unstructured data and then NoSQL came. It changed the way we were dealing with data.Now , you dont have to define table column datatype, you dont have to put size on table columns , you have all these features . I really enjoy working with MongoDB, easy too horizontally scale using daemon process and replication is also very easy, not much different in syntax from traditional RDBMS, thus learning curve is easy.
Cons: Miss core features of MySQL databases, No more transactions , committing “Excellent database with high performance and high availability compred to other no SQL options ”
Overall: Lesser time to migrate from RDBMS to NoSQL, Option to store the data on mobile/client side and sync option to server/cloud. Flexibility.
Pros: The data queries have faster response, it is more simlple with excellent load balancing. Also the security part it is far more secure and reliable compared to other memcached providers. Migration fro traditional RDBMS system is as well smooth without much struggle.
Cons: Memory/RAM useage shoots-up to roof most of the times, degraded performance when working on the very large databses. Better tools for data analysis and management would be good thing, console is good but not enough “Best Non-Relational Database for developers”
Pros: I use MongoDB.It's high-performing for simple queries.And it is flexibility - I can add new columns or fields on MongoDB without affecting existing rows or application performance.This database systems can be expanded horizontally. Thousands of servers can operate as a cluster and can handle very large data.The database doesn't require a database administrator. I prefer to use MongoDB in my projects. Indeed, it is worth the use of MongoDB.
Cons:  This gives you the flexibility to change your data schema without modifying any of your existing data. Sharding support-the feature of sharing large-scale data among servers is also one of the surplus values that distinguishes MongoDB from similar ones. If you want speedy db use MongoDB. “Secure data storage with NoSQL”
Pros: It is a very easy to use software with a good storage, offering intuitive tools to allow to store data in a secure way while the developer chooses a key that will be the access key. It is simply perfect for our company and the opportunity to store data in order to avoid any misplacement of them. It has a good balance of them and you can make inquiries with java Script.
Cons: Mongo DB can present problems after a standard of 100 GB, it tends to paralyze and this can be a bit complicated. It is a fairly complete software, it is simply perfect for our company and the opportunity to store data in order to avoid any misplacement of them. It has a good balance of them and you can make inquiries with java Script. “MongoDB Review”
Overall: Overall it is a good choice for handling unstructured data with the ease.
Pros: MongoDB is not a RDMS database( i.e NoSQL Database) which helps to store any kind of unstructured data. Fault tolerant fail over and sharding databases makes easy to handle large amount of data without any data loss. MongoDB Driver is available for all popular languages and it works greatly with Big Data. we can retrieve output as JSON , which makes the data more readable. There is no need for writing complex queries like RDBMS and it is very easy to install.
Cons: Difficult to retrieve data from the combination of more than one collections. Free version offers only limited memory to handle data.  “NoSQL based databse with easy replication and horizontal scaling”
Pros: MySQL has several limitations, like strict datatype, no horizontal scaling, and difficult replication but MongoDB solves it all. It allows horizontal scaling, replication and it relaxes the constraints of strict datatypes. In today's time when rapid development is required, MongoDB comes very handy. A MongoDB demon will keep running in the background that helps you with all replication and scaling process.
Cons: You will definitely miss transaction type features in MongoDB “Great DB for agile projects”
Overall: Very flexible and great fit for new JavaScript frameworks that use JSON.
Pros: This is probably the best document-oriented database. Since it is not relation-based database, it can better handle design mistakes that developer might make during iteration of agile development. Every change is very simple and convenient. As it has very useful validation of JSON data based on JSON definitions, it makes it very mistake protective. It is also very scalable, can be distributed, and again, scale horizontally for better performance, if you need them.
Cons: It does not have referential integrity, which makes it little complicated to use when you need defined, related and enforced relations between pieces of data, especially in big environments. When database grows, it can easily be very unefficient considering stored data vs real storage on the disk. “The game changer DB”
Overall: Best DB for startuppers. You can choose a self-hosted or cloud-hosted solution.
Pros: An easy to start and master database solution. It's a "must-know" for a back-end developer. You can quickly start a project without worries to have already thought about data structure. Best noSQL solution! A really good idea that changed software development. For a startup or an "always changing" software, it is a must.
Cons: A little bit too easy to mess up data :). Maybe not the best solution to heavy relational data (eg transactions). “Our first approach to non-relational DBs”
Pros: We're starting a new project, an idea management platform. So far we've worked with relational DBs, but given the nature of the project we decided to give MongoDB a try. We're using the open source version, so the pricing is unbeatable. We can handle 1mln documents as a breeze (although we probably never will) and what we would do with a number of tables, queries and joins is now done with a single find() over a single collection, which is frankly amazing and made us wonder how much time we wasted until now. Writing a simple CRUD application is a matter of hours starting from zero. The Java driver does a lot of what you'll need, including de/serialization of pojos and connection pooling. This is nice, less choices to make! The MongoDB University offers free online courses (they seem to be of nice quality) and certifications.
Cons: The change from RDBMS to documental is a strong paradigm shift. We're just waiting the day we'll have to redo everything from scratch... and we hope it's going to be soon. The command shell and especially the Java driver have a weird interface. There's an incredible amount of ways to get to the same task, and it seems that MongoDB is suffering by "featuritis", which is natural since *it is* a commercial product. You can't take the courses when you want: they're only presented in conjunction with examinations which are periodical. You might still want to wait for one, because he amount of available single videos is otherwise overwhelming. “Great DB, if you know what you're doing”
Pros: One of the best NoSQL DBs currently available. Beware, this statement is only true if you know what you're doing. If you're trying to use NoSQL DB where clearly a relation DB should be used, you're gonna have a bad time. It's also great for fast prototyping - don't have to mess with SQL migrations when you change DB structure a lot.
Cons: I think the indexing options are still a little bit lacking... Compared to the even older versions, the progress is very good. “One of the Best No SQL Document Database”
Pros: Index is really easy. Reads/writes are very fast. Query language is simple and easy to understand. Since it is no sql document database with json documents, it works with most of the current application which depend on json for interaction between components.
Cons: Advanced concepts like scaling and sharding may need mongodb consultants help. Available Mongodb clients like Robomongo is not easy to use. Will definitely need lot of learning before implementing in project. “process, store nosql based data”
Pros: The rise of mongoDB lies in the inability of MySQL in dealing with not structured data. MongoDB can process and store anay data where datatype requirements and data structure , size requirements can be relaxed and additionally it can easily scaled.
Cons: MySQL is a recognized software for many features, few important features are transaction , commit, rollback which is highly helpful in many instances but are absent in MongoDB “Retrieving data is really easy if they well organized”
Overall: It is really a good solution for database management and analytics. we can store any kind of structured document as a json documents.And there is plenty of query operations to retrieve data and there is "lookup" operation for connect different kind of data collections.It is really easy to process data with mongo.But when we store data and if they not organized well it will consume time more than normally.
Pros: Ability to store data in any structure
Cons: There are lot of limitation when using "lookup" operation to connect two collections “The most flexible database!”
Overall: Great piece of software that vastly simplifies Backend development.
Pros: MongoDB is one of the most versatile and forgiving databases I've ever used. It's easy to set up, scales well and it performs great for most CRUD applications. Especially for Javascript devs, you feel right at home with its JSON-like document store. Not much else to say about it, if I was quickly creating an application and time spent in development was critical, I'd almost definitely use MongoDB.
Cons: There are some performance trade-offs, but at the scale of most applications, it certainly won't be your bottleneck. “MongoDB: Popular nosql database”
Pros: If you are a JavaScript person then it will be very easy to understand mongodb and use it as it stores data in the form of json that is the standard data format in JavaScript and even in web communication such as api request and response. Using package like simpleSchema we can use it very similar to sql databse with the benefits of a nosql database.
Cons: Query syntax of mongodb is not very good. They should follow a similar pattern for all types of queries but rather different syntax is followed. For example select document query syntax is very different to select collection. “The best friend of nodejs and json”
Pros: - Extremely efficient to integrate with big data - It is very easy of scale - The integration with nodejs and graphql is something completely natural - The speed and usability that the minimongo gives for mobile applications are very nice. - It is very easy to incorporate or deprecate field on collection.
Cons: - Security is scarce or difficult to configure and integrate - Few free providers available in the cloud. (After using free tier) “Wrote a new product using Mongo DB. A great noSQL DB. ”
Overall: Love Mongo DB Life is really good. Fast Dev Cycles
Pros: I love how easy it is to store JSON documents. No need to pack and unpack data just store objects with how I use it on my application server. Mongo scales very easy. Ran a production system for 3 years with zero downtime. You can 't beat the cost.
Cons: Better tooling would be a huge help. You can do everything in the command line but some tasks that you don't use every day take time to look up and execute. “MongoDB - Best NoSQL database”
Overall: We are using MongoDB for document based records where preferences for million users are stored in a collection and each user can have its own preferences. Even we have surveys from users filled in MongoDB
Pros: 1. No SQL document-oriented. Leave your hassles of schema definition behind. 2. Scale it for trillion records reds per day 3. Cluster config is easy.
Cons: 1. Learning query language is a curve you need to follow. 2. Complex joins are a hassle. But manageable. “the best nosql DB on the market”
Pros: it's for sure the best NoSQL DB on the market. It's powerful and there is a huge community that works with it. the cloud service, provided by MongoDB itself, it's really easy to use but powerful as well and it doesn't cost more than other service providers.
Cons: sometimes, if you decide to manage your cluster by yourself on your infrastructure, please pay attention to resources (RAM and Disk) “Easy and fast”
Pros: NoSQL is a necessity and MongoDb is providing that concrete bridge for you. Easy to set up, easy to configure, fast connections and easy error handling. It's a powerful DB which fulfills majority of your new in your small projects as well as enterprise level requirements.
Cons: The way we have workbench for MySQL, can we have somewhat better for MongoDB? Other than that, I see no cons yet. “An incredible database structure regarding the use of NoSQL”
Overall: If you want a database to work in a simple and fast way in your applications, MongoDB is a very good option.
Pros: When I work with the structure of the databases in MongoDB it is extremely simple, it has qualities that simplify the queries since it is executed from JavaScript and is performed asynchronously.
Cons: It has simple structures, which limits the use of this one a lot since it can block the database while you are modifying the database. “When you wan't flexibility with your data”
Overall: It's a database, that allowed us to easily change data structures throughout ongoing development, till we were satisfied with the effect.
Pros: You can put pretty much anything inside, it's a great database, when you're not sure, what structure of data will you get from the client.
Cons: Mongo syntax makes simple queries look extremely complicated at times. You need to keep in mind it handles simple reads and inserts best. “One of the best NoSQL database”
Overall: Overall it is best database for supporting data from Internet of the things. Now data is coming in different formats and unstructured so MongoDB helps in that.
Pros: It supports to store JSON like documents in database. It supports NOSQL database programming. It has great features like load balancing , indexing, Capped collections and indexing etc. Best thing in MongoDB it is supports transactional database, and supports ACID.
Cons: I really don't have any negative side. But by nature MongoDB is NOSQL, So it is little complex than SQL supported database for data analysis. “Document based, nosql database, ideal for quick and MEAN stack development.”
Pros: M in MEAN stack stands for Mongodb. Its a document based nosql database . Here you dont have to define datatype and structures and sizes for all columns. Also, you can extend the capabilities by scaling it, that is not easily done in MySQL. Many companies are preferring Mongodb for nosql database.
Cons: There are many features in MySQL that are yet to implement in MongoDb “Mongo DB review”
Overall: Very good
Pros: Mongo DB one of the most leading documents database. The is the gaint in no SQL . The concept of no SQL is the alternative of relational database management system, so when we use this mongo DB it's take less time to make database modal and save the development time. The second thing which is important the process and loading time decreased of any applicable or software which is using mongodb, because it's just get all the data in one go without making any logic in server side.
Cons: This is one of the complete software in it self , most importantly open source software, still because of new software you would not find much help over inter for your problem. “Best NoSQL”
Pros: 1. Very easy to learn. 2. Free educational resources. 3. Off course schema less 4. Replication. 5. Querying is relatively east compared to other NoSQL solutions.
Cons: 1. Difficult to set up properly and manage too. 2. Joining data can be a bit hairy. 3. Set up and maintenance can also be rather complicated without paid tools. 4. Need to plan heavenly before creating db schema “Handle unstructured data in best way”
Overall: It behaves as primary storage medium for many of our projects. It easily distinguishes between the data formats which is feeded to it for us. It is very necessary for us for the huge unstructured data we have.
Pros: Great replication and performance on cloud as well as virtual machines. We use mongo db on all of our grids. Mongo db is very easy to get started because it has very flexible schema. We can easily replicate the databases and get out of box solutions for the database scripts everytime. We can handle large chunks of unstructured data with mongodb. It has great mapreduce functions to make the tasks easier.
Cons: There is nothing to dislike in mongo. I just want that the scripting languages could be made a little shorthand. “Not relational database and not structured database but efficient in Scaling ”
Pros: It's not a relational database , also it's not a stuctured database. It's a database where you don't follow strictly datatype requirements and size requirements, its highly useful in fast and small size development of applications.
Cons: It is not the MySQL, that's the least like thing, MySQL was everyone's favorite till huge data came into play.  “Excelent”
Overall: In my company we use mongoDB as our database. We use mongo Cloud also.
Pros: A very good document type database. Very easy to create collections. And the good thing is we can change the collection structure any time.

Pros: It is very easy to setup, and its usage is very intuitive. It is very easy to scale and there are straight forwards ORMs to use it like Mongoose.
Cons: In general it is pretty good, I had some issues regarding concurrency, it may have some limitations on that side.“ open code oriented to non-sql documents.”
Overall: it is worth investing in this product in many aspects both in data backup and security and in its excellent use of the tool for its monitoring and data management.
Pros: is a powerful non-sql database and open source, this allows us to better manage data one of its great virtues in qe we can execute multiple tasks directly from javascrip without anything in additional, its file system allows greater security to the Dasastres time is also equipped with a large system that allows the implementation in multiple machines closter.
Cons: among the things that really do not fill me completely with this platform is that at the time of implementation is a bit difficult because the support material for it is a bit cumbersome to understand and that by exceeding a certain base size of data begins to present latency. “Great database alternative to RDBMS”
Pros: Very simple to set up and nosql is awesome for easily setting up collections to be saved. Very powerful as it is used as part of the MEAN stack. Using it as a basic db to learn spring mvc. Provides official tools for connecting and editing documents and collections.
Cons: Not much to complain about. Very excellent tool for me to quickly learn spring rest without any hassle for setting up tables and structured data. “Advance way to save data”
Overall: Earlier we were using sql server but now we have started work through mongo db as it provide massive speed with larger amount of data.
Pros: It provide greate performace even we have large amount of data. It also support various tools like apache's and terrastore. It store the complex data in simpler format so we do not worry about advance concept like RDBMS. It automatically manage your data and return the result through simpler query.
Cons: As it support various types of tool which increased its sized and lead to slow speed of system. It does not support to relational queries we have to do it manually. “Best tool to store complex data”
Overall: Saved online shopping data and client credentials.
Pros: It is very useful if we want to store dependency data. It provide easy way to manage large data. Dynamic queries and stored procedure is very easy to create and execute. It is also provide high sequrity.
Cons: When we retrieve data from large table it takes time as this store the records based on key value pair. Overall this is best tool but i would like some performance in it. “Mongo is very productive”
Overall: Storing app data in the cloud on on mobile. client-side storage with syn ability to serverside is really good, and minimongo in the browser is really nice to work with
Pros: I really like the document store idea. The javascript integration is really good and the built-in security features and ecosystems is great. I like how quick u can go from idea to a working model
Cons: Sometimes it feels inflexible when compared to traditional RDBMS. Also, i found the security documentation lacking initially although this is much better today. You cannot be as verbose with your queries by any means and related data feels clunky. “Excellent No-SQL Database support complex query and all data type”
Overall: We use MongoDB as our main No-SQL database in our application which needs to ingest JSON and XML files from input source then use it in our business and make the call to other systems via Rest API and receive a response which uses XML and JSON format
Pros: MongoDB has a powerful query language which has almost complex command as the relational database such as join, subquery, aggregate and indexing, it allows to filter, sort or calculate any field which located inside a document and support the full ACID transaction. MongoDB supports JSON, XML, document type allow us to store whole Rest API response or a ingest document into the database and still support full search and filter instead of parsing it to fields before storing. MongoDB is easy to configure as a cluster for high availability, horizontal scaling
Cons: MongoDB consumes a lot of HDD when we add many indexes and the query which involve lookup command is quite slow and its document is quite confusing “MongoDB is the go-to open source database solution”
Overall: Great database tool! Keep up the good work!
Pros: MongoDB is an excellent database solution for the open source developer. I've been using it for years and find it beats other products by far!
Cons: No main cons with the MongoDB product so far. “Seriously consider just using SQL”
Pros: It's fast, very fast, and it's capable of storing large amounts of data. It's very simple to pick up and use since you can just stick documents in a new collection.
Cons: No joins. Atomic modifiers only work on single objects, so you can't do multi collection transactions on a single database. While MongoDB's nature lets you be very loose with how you design your database, you will need to plan out the schema carefully and strictly to account for these or have massive regrets later. Cleaning up records that become out of sync is a pain in the ass. Was not ACID compliant until recently. “NOSql=NoHassle: (MongoDB, db);”
Overall: One of the best document oriented DB. It can be conveniently installed on windows and Linux both. It's definitely a time saving platform compared to traditional Sql Database.
Pros: One can quickly create a database with just one command of different rows having different data types. Indexing is the best part of MongoDb. User-defined compound Indices makes it quite convenient which saves alot of memory and time.
Cons: Must have knowledge of coding as it doesn't have a user friendly interface. Sql queries are not available. Security is not provided by default. It must be manually configured. “Amazing database”
Overall: Overall experience is amazing. I am still using it with most of my development, which includes e commerce and social media apps.

Cons: For relational use it is a bit hard to get. “The database platform everyone should be using”
Pros: It's a database platform that works and allows you to model data in real world scenarios, rather than having to fit real world data around a rigid structure
Cons: The tooling isn't readily available or great, but this is really a nice to have “The best free and open-source database server.”
Pros: MongoDB brings a lot of functionalities and high performance. It is a free and open source cross platform database program.
Cons: MongoDB is a NoSQL database which means for some SQL database developers this change could take some extra time. “It is the best NoSQL database”
Overall: Get knowledge about NoSQL, learn the new syntax to build querys and professional experience. And the most important thing is to provide solutions to customers for the management of a lot of data.
Pros: I like the features about NoSQL database: scalability and flexibility in querys. I like the new concepts in this software: Collections have documents.
Cons: I would like to have a database manager that allows making a backup and restore easier with just a click “"Need flexibility? Here comes MongoDB."”
Overall: I am a student. I have been using MongoDB in my academic projects and in my internship projects as well. I am pursuing my masters in software engineering and we use MongoDB entirely for every project that we do. In my internship at Ingram Micro Ltd. I did one project where the backend was on MongoDB.
Pros: Store metadata - MongoDB is best to use when we have to deal with a huge amount of metadata. Scalability - MongoDB does scale well in comparison to other document specific databases. Data handling - It manages data in documents.
Cons: It's a bit hard to learn and code using MongoDB. No specific UI for management of a database. “Good NoSQL Database”
Pros: MongoDB is one of the most powerful NoSQL databases there, it's fast and quite easy to use. Being a NoSQL, it allows to mold the and extra data when need without the need of alterming the schema.
Cons: As powerful as MongoDB is, it's not the right choice for all the use cases. Lack of consistency, or concurrency problems are main disadvantages of MongoDB in my view.  “highly recognized NOSQL database ”
Pros: If you are dealing with clients who are not sure about the data size or any particular format, you should probably use MongoDB, it's a NoSQL based database. No need to define any size or any datatypes. Also, replication and horizontal scaling are two features that make it more useful software.
Cons: Few traditional database based features will not be present “Mongo DB is high performance open source platform suitable mostly for small organisations.”
Pros: Key feature of Mongo DB is its high performance as data objects are saved in separate document. It is very flexible i.e. deletion or adding any fields hardly affects the application. Mongo DB does not allow joins hence data retrieval becomes more faster. Mongo DB is very useful for small organisations working on mobile and social networking sites.
Cons: No stored procedure or functions are supported be Mongo hence it is very difficult to bind complex logics. It is not good for organisations where large number of transactions takes place. “Best NoSQL Database for Developers”
Overall: Easy to setup and use is a huge benefit in MongoDB as well as free clusters available in MongoDB Atals is always helpful in small projects.
Pros: MongDB is one of the best NoSQL, doucment databases available right now. It has plugins developed for almost all the languages, frameworks as well as a big community that is using MongoDB is very helpful since they are people to help you to overcome any problem. In general I prefer working with MongoDB rather than SQL databases due to the felxibility and the less restrictions. However, it will depend on the requirement.
Cons: Generally I do not have anything I do not like about MongoDB, except the UI provide by MongoDB Atlas which is moved from mLab. “Good software but some improvements required”
Overall: My experience with mango db is good but could have been excellent , only onthing that is it cannot huge loads
Pros: I am from company called orderhive we are inventory management software and we use mango db to store products related information. Best part about mango db is searching and sorting .
Cons: Cannot handle huge loads and fails quite often “Great database for enterprise with features being added all the time.”
Overall: Performance and flexibility.
Pros: Good performance, with an expressive and ever-expanding query language. The company is very responsive to users' feature requests.
Cons: No concept of ACID transactions (yet, coming soon), requiring users to think very carefully about certain mission-critical tasks. Query language is a bit verbose and confusing at times. “Basic stable database solution”
Pros: We never have to do any maintenance for MongoDB to run
Cons: Its different from SQL Server or MY-SQL - so you have to know how to manage it. “The best DB Ever”
Overall: I used to use relational databases. When I discovered MongoDB and the non-relational universe, I try to use MongoDB as much as I can.
Pros: Very powerful and fast, full of functionalities and well documented.
Cons: It should have a Node Client full of promises support. On Node, everything is tring to not use callback anymore, but Mongo is still on callbacks. “I used it for the first time for an application developed in java I already knew how JSON”
Overall: Learn non-relational structure
Pros: It is a very light and flexible database accepts any type of data is very scalable the response time is very fast
Cons: There is not enough documentation at the moment of having errors when using arrays within the arrangements, the functions of the CRUD are a little complicated to the database “The experience is wonderful, handling large amounts of data in seconds, in a simple way.”
Overall: It has allowed me to be able to store and handle large volumes of data, this is wonderful to perform data analysis; In addition, to be able to save codes in JSON that will be used in the website, it is very good!
Pros: Loading data to MONGODB in JSON format is the maximum, since it allows to integrate JavaScritp with the data base in a more efficient way. It is very flexible, having unstructured data, allows us to perform updates without major complications. In addition, the high speed in data recovery is extraordinary for managing large volumes of data, one million records in a few minutes!. It is great!
Cons: It is not efficient with the available storage space; In addition, you can not validate the fields that are saved, so there may be inconsistency in the data. It is not very clear to use the "use" command to access the database and collections. “Great DB”
Pros: The few best part of this DB are - Ease of use - Easy to become productive - Easy indexing - Easy to install - Query language - Easy to scale
Cons: As using it I did not find any major drawbacks but Initial write issues in an early version and even though Concurrency limitations are major concern “MongoDB is a wonderful breath of fresh air”
Overall: I can store data that doesn't have to conform to a SQL database and that is huge for me. I can also store data horizontally and not vertically.
Pros: When I need to store data that isn't relational, Mongo is where I turn. It makes my life so much easier, and I can do all the things I want and don't have to worry about conforming to a SQL db. “It is a tool that allows me to store volumes of data in an easy and simple way”
Overall: When working with NoSQL databases, whether they are open source or have an owner, the expansion is easier and cheaper than when working with relational databases
Pros: It allows me to interact with data processing software in an easy way. It allows to store volumes of data in an easy and simple way. It is easy to manage and manage
Cons: Most NoSQL databases do not support reliability functions, which are supported by relational database systems. Other forms of complexity found in most NoSQL databases include incompatibility with SQL queries “Nonrelational database for scalability”
Overall: My overall experience with MongoDB has been pretty solid. Nothing much to complain about, it must be used for the proper use case.
Pros: I like how scalable MongoDB is and how it can be used for workflows with extreme speed and high availability otherwise unachievable with relational SQL databases. It also has pretty good support.
Cons: I least like that MongoDB is not ACID compliant, in the sense that data consistency is eventual and not consistent right away. “MongoDB”
Overall: I worked 2 years with MongoDB and I happy to lean some features of it
Pros: Fast installation, works perfect and save results fast. Modern Data Base ever. Works with nodeJS perfectly
Cons: NoSQL, really flexible, fast response from database and really fast search filed, can add new field without difficulties “Probably the best NoSQL database out there!”
Overall: It's a good NoSQL database. But you should know the right time to use Mongo. Otherwise you're only making things more complicated. like in table joins and so on. If you have a lightweight project with no strict requirement of table joins, then try Mongo. It's gonna perform really fast in times like those.
Pros: MongoDB is very useful when you're working on a lightweight project. t performs very fast in such occasions. And the queries are very easy to understand. Especially when you have some knowledge in JS, this is even easier to understand the queries. It has got a built-in security ecosystem that is very reliable. And there are lot of good tutorials provided by MongDB university .
Cons: yeah this has some weaknesses too. Like , if your project needs JOIN operation , probably you should stick to SQL . And you're probably gonna face some issues with concurrent transactions. “Great enterprise level NoSQL database”
Overall: Fantastic, my first choice for NoSQL databases.
Pros: As a frontend developer, MongoDB is of course a great resource. The setup has always been easy because there are great supporting products for hosting and viewing data such as mLab and Mongo Compass. Backend libraries, such as Mongoose, are well supported and work fairly well.
Cons: Executing complicated queries can be very difficult to learn, even in comparison to a typical SQL language. “One of the best No SQL database in market”
Pros: The scalability is one of the biggest advantage of MongoDB. Also, it has handle storing of different types of datasets including videos, images.
Cons: A simplified Graphical User Interface to handle datasets can greatly help in bringing the software to wide variety of users. “Best solution for Non-functional databases”
Overall: Overall it is a very good database management system. It was very helpful for my University projects. So MongoDB is one of the best DBMS for the modern world.
Pros: MongoDB is the best solution for modern-day database management. It is very efficient and easy to integrate data. It was very helpful for my final year university project. It supports various kinds of features for users like non-relational form. MongoDB is also well structured and has lots of inbuilt functions.
Cons: It is not easy for beginners. Because it is not easy to create procedures and functions. It also has some programming issues when integrating. “Best nonsql db”
Pros: Very reliable, easy to use, well documented
Cons: Requires more examples for different clients “MongoDB Management Experience”
Overall: Useful for modelling social graph data and catalog data
Pros: Easy setup with various SDKs Good replication strategy Aggregation modelling is very straight forward
Cons: Collection indexing is very hard to update Increased memory usage “Best NoSQL database ”
Overall: Overall experience is very good. Its very easy to learn, use and quick start. If you someone wants to learn and start working with NoSql, MongoDB is the best option.
Pros: It is document oriented database. Json is stored directly in database, so no need any middle-ware. highly scale-able. Very easy to use.
Cons: No GUI. need to use Compass separately. More Validation options at Document level. Sometime need to work like sql so get some difficulties. “ORM & NoSQL FTW!”
Pros: When it comes to NoSQL database, MongoDB is the choice for every web developer. It has collections in it and every collection has records in it. Its ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is one of its kind which makes the database very efficient and clutter free. One of the greatest principle is schema-less behavior, where the data type of an object is not strict to its usage. It especially useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB can be used with any kind of backend technology stack like Django, Node.js, etc. It comes with a DB explorer called compass which is useful to explore the database and its various collections.
Cons: There won't be any pitfall in it until you need joins and aggregate queries in your data. It's not optimnized for such queries. “Very simplistic approach to NoSQL database”
Pros: I have recently started working in JS frameworks and storing data itself in JSON like like format is simply great. MongoDB does exactly that. It stores the data in form of documents unlike another relational databases. Even a person with no knowledge of RDBMS can understand its simplistic approach of a database. It allows us to store huge amount of structured and unstructured data with ease. The effort taken in database design is minimal and we can develop applications really fast.
Cons: Although its great in the job it does, I believe security is an aspect where it lags a little. More features can be added to make it more secure and trustworthy for applications such as banking and other organizations which handle sensitive data. “I used MongoDB to quickly bootstrap an application before setting a schema.”
Overall: I was able to quickly start working on an app without stressing over data schema. By creating an abstraction layer between the database and my API, I could switch to a structured database like Postgres relatively easily when the time came.
Pros: There is extensive documentation for working with Mongo in almost every programming language, and it is very intuitive to see what your data is shaped like. There are many free tools to view and manipulate data as well.
Cons: This may be more related to how you actually use the software, but you should have an abstraction layer between the database and your API so that changes to the schema or provider don't break your app. “The best nosql database I know”
Overall: Great flexibility in database structure, main goal of a nosql database.
Pros: Siple and powerful works great out of the box without particular configuration. It's very well documented. Sharding and replica are advanced functionalities that makes this product very professional and useful for big applications.
Cons: It lacks of a sync protocol that allows the offline use of an instance and the auto update when the connection will be available again. “No relational DB Made green ”
Overall: Mongo DB helped me with some PoCs (Proof of concept) .In most of this cases we dont have a relational model of our data base so in order to do quick test we just save up everything that the server or the apis we are using send to us.So the WEB front taked everthing and draw beatifull views from it. I hope they can do something with the querys over it so is not as easy as SQL.
Pros: Easy setup Easy conection Like relationals querys tools (not relationals at all ) Several plataforms compatibility windows , linux ,etc Easy instalation on server and exposition to internet. Good documentations Nice comunnity
Cons: We have issues with the hard relationls querys we are normally used to . But after some coding we developed and equivallent. “Mongo db is the best db ever !!!”
Pros: Mongo db is not like traditional dbs it has more capabilities it keeps data as documents and it is belongs to No SQL databases. data sizes are not fixed. Mongo DB is very faster than other Databases, I recommended every developers to use this Mongo db to any data stored process.
Cons: Mongo DB is very complex one so every one didn't understand this. “MongoDB: The best NoSQL Database”
Pros: -Ease of use -Easy to install -Great for startups -Rich query language -High availability with replica sets -Scales easily with Sharding -Powerful set of Aggregate functions -Fast performance -MongoDB offers Stitch to help reduce backend code throught it's API -Great community -Big Data ready
Cons: -Aggregation framework can be difficult for new users -Re-sharding can be difficult -Monitoring can be cumbersome “MongoDB - Terrific NoSQL database”
Overall: Overall, for a NoSQL database, MongoDB is the best!
Pros: Overall, MongoDB is easy to use and implement in innumerable applications. For personal projects to enterprise, the flexibility of implementation, especially when used in conjunction with Node.js, Node Express, React or Vue, the results can be very efficient and effective. Love using Mongoose NPM with applications implementing Mongo and Robo3T for checking collections
Cons: Very little. Only problems come along when depreciated methods that I haven't caught in the docs occur. These are minor errors and are easily rectified. “A nice big data storage system”
Pros: I used mongodb shortly in one of my products and we found it very easy to use due to the way it stores data. We stored user session data in mongodb. We didn't have to worry about the scale, staleness of data and caching as mongodb provides in house support for all of these.I would recommend it for a session management kind of use case that it served for us. “Best cloud MongoDB solution!”
Overall: Managed MongoDB solution (instead of running our own backups, monitoring and replicaset)
Pros: UI is intuitive. Implementation is a breeze. Instructions on installing software is straightforward. Pricing is great. Their monitoring and backup tools are great and resourceful.
Cons: The only draw back was that we weren't able to use their MongoDB cluster in production (we were stuck on Python 2.6 for the time being) “Great for non-RDBMS ”
Overall: I use MongoDb to save and retrieve data for my day to day work. It works quite fine and have not given any problem yet. It is quite easy to use once you get use to.
Pros: I like the way MongoDb works. Stores and retrieve data in JSON format. easily scalable for better performance.
Cons: The installation is confusing I suppose. and Limited Data Size is another. The UI can be more user friendly “My experience with mongo db after usage of 1 year”
Overall: we are used the mongo db in rpa automation projects to store and manipulating the process information
Pros: Easy to use , easy to perform complex operations on bson documents,we can easy insert json data,fast querying results and when compared with other databases we can easily install configure the mongo db, good documentation.
Cons: mongo db is schema free and documentation “document storage, NOT a DB”
Pros: good to store documents and unschema data, fast insert and select if from one table
Cons: joining is hell, performance is worse. If you want this go to regular DB, support aweful “A powerful database for your company”
Pros: Mongo DB is an easy-to-use software with a large database called NoSQL that allows storage in large quantities. Scalable and decentralized without strong resource requirements.
Cons: On several occasions I have had problems uploading the documents to their database, this is a bit tedious and I would really be grateful if you could solve this problem. “Best back end database to save your data.”
Overall: By storing data of multiple organisations with our softwares helps us to make benefits.
Pros: Where we are using data structure in JSON format, MongoDB will be the best back end database to store it. The best is that it is free and open source. It is very easy to setup it and get started working on it. Very much user friendly. It supports multiple languages JAVA, JavaScript , C , C++ etc.
Cons: The app which has some complex transaction MongoDB will not be the best option. It consumes more memory as it is stores key values with every data. “Great noSQL which support also Schema ”
Overall: Very easy to integrate into my node.js backend project
Pros: Open source, mongoose library, It's a JSON database and you use Javascript language to talk to it , great resource and documentation, available also university and lectures on company website, fast query execution.
Cons: Till now i haven t found anything to complain. Maybe would be nice to have a library like mongoose released and maintained by the team “Flexible and easy to setup.”
Pros: The Schemaless design makes rapid prototyping and iteration incredibly easy. The free tier platforms make it a great option for trying out and can take you incredibly far though there are great options/support provided for Enterprise services. For programmers, there are many well-maintained libraries for wrapping around the API.
Cons: Though the database itself is fantastic, the third party tools to manage DBs are only ok. They are improving, but tools like 3T and Robomongo don't take complete advantage of the schemaless model. “The Best Database”
Overall: I used MongoDB as a database for my school project and I'm very satisfied.
Pros: I used MongoDB in my react.js project. It's a great service because it has clear blocks of code and a very understandable document.
Cons: I don't think it's a problem. It offers you a database for testing and you can easily connect. It's perfect. “Extremely useful for large data”
Pros: This is the best solution for NOSQL databases. Data architecture was a plus
Cons: A bit hard to grasp at the beginning. I had to dig deep in the documentation “Easy to deploy and support is really nice”
Pros: MongoDB is easy to install and use. It has a lot of libraries in a lot of languages for your project. Also, all libraries have the best implementation to avoid a connection overhead.
Cons: Everything is easy until you want to deploy a replica set. High availability only is possible with three devices running MongoDB. “one of the best NoSql family database”
Overall: Most probably for the need to noSql database, it is best and free available system
Pros: We are using this database to store the user's raw data in JSON format like user's activity. As this is nosql database so you can easily store the unstructured data. MongoDB can easily be coupled with BigData ecosystem with high throughput. It's scalability is also amazing with available features like sharding.
Cons: I have using this for last 1 year but didn't see any negatives of this tool. But you need to choose when to use NoSql database and when to use relational database. “Great way to stored complex data using Non Relational Database MongoDB”
Pros: MongoDB being Schema less makes it possible to store data of any structure.
Cons: Aggregation Capabilities of MongoDB is slower than Relational Database “A Great database !”
Overall: Overall it's a great tool till now, with easy queries for handling huge database.
Pros: 1. You can write in simple queries very easily. New columns can be added without affecting the existing ones. 2. You can store data, without having to worrying about loosing it or getting it misplaced. 3. It's a great tool for all the back-end developers when compared to the other competitors. 4. A huge number of documents/data can be handled at ease.
Cons: 1. The interface to the command shell can be improved. 2. You need to spend a good amount of time in learning, so that's obvious though. 3. Robomongo is not that easy to use. 4. Some advanced concepts may require the help from a professional. “Developer's dream database”
Pros: Super user-friendly, open source, robust functionality and even some ML capabilities
Cons: NoSQL is tough to use for super complex queries, which is limiting in this case “Review for Mongo DB”
Pros: The best no sql database ever i have used. Meet all requirements and easy to scale.
Cons: It doesn't support some functions which are provided by SQL like indexing. “The NOSQL solution and reliable”
Pros: Easy to install and configure.Performance is good.Stores data is flexible JSON format.Easy to learn the concepts.Other associated tools with MogoDB are also useful for eg. MongoDB compass tool.
Cons: User interface can be more improved.Joins are not supported in Mongo. Sometimes lags due to large number of requests. “Review about MongoDB”
Overall: I used it to create a student result management system project. It helps to effectively use large amounts of data.
Pros: Speed and scalability are better than other databases like MySQL. It is most suitable for the non-relational database.
Cons: It is not suitable for the relational database. Hence we can't create joins. If we need the joins, better to use other databases like SQL. “Highly Flexible NoSQL Databases with Strong Community Support”
Pros: The best part of my experience using MongoDB has to be its ease of use and tiny learning curve. Coming from a Javascript heavy development background, MongoDB's JSON data representation, document oriented collections, and easy to use api has made my transition into back-end development extremely smooth. To top it off, MongoDB also released an NPM package called Mongoose that makes the experience even better. Creating schemas becomes dead simple and adding pre and post save operations to these schemas allows you to run custom validations before being saved to the database. While these features are possible on the native MongoDB package, Mongoose make the whole process much more organized and simple.
Cons: One thing that annoyed me was the inability to delete certain fields inside of a saved document in the database. You are allowed to delete the entire document itself, but unable to delete fields within the individual document without running commands to do so. “Great for fast-changing requirements”
Overall: I was trying to store document-based data in a persistent store. Traditional SQL databases could do this job, but it was funny splitting this data into multiple tables. MongoDB enabled me to store data as is - and to retrieve it easily when needed.
Pros: For me it worked well in two cases: 1. When you work on the project where you have a lot of changes in the data format and you don't want and need to lose time by updating old data, MongoDB can be your solution. 2. When you are working with data that is naturally document-oriented, using MongoDB just feels natural.
Cons: Joining data can be challenging. Also, 16 MB document size limit is something you should be aware of. Overall: We are using MongoDB to store user information in our website.
Pros: * It's really easy to integrate with your backend-solution. * I am using Python-DJango, and you only need to download some libraries add some imports and you are ready to go. * Since you are storing information in a non-relation way, it's really easy to interact with it with Python. *MongoDB configuration UI is great, you can configure on minutes and it allows you to scale your solution with few clicks.

Overall: We are currently using this database to support a Disccount system in the company I work for, wich is a reatil store. It is fast for processing large number of json and xml files.
Pros: I had only worked with relational databases prior my experience with mongo db. So far this has been a positive experience, mongo db was very easy to install by using YUM and easy con configure with it's parameter file.
Cons: Because it's so different than SQL, there is a learning curve you need to pass to get the full out of this product. “Good for projects of all sizes”
Overall: We were able to deploy a small application on Amazon's EC2 instance without paying extra for any other hosting service
Pros: A lot of third-party libraries and connectors are available for MongoDB in various languages which makes it easy to use in all types of projects. Simple installation and a very good GUI/cmdline query interface
Cons: Hosting options are limited, also since it is not relational database, there is a learning curve to perform basic CRUD operations “Flexible and powerful”
Overall: In general it is good, fast, easy, despite some difficulties it is a very good database to work with today, even though it is not relational.
Pros: Mongo DB is free and very fast for data processing and easy to learn and use. Javascript backend integration is very goodCould have a friendlier tool for management
Cons: Could have a friendlier tool for management. The database administration interface is not very good, but it works. “Excellent cloud storage solution”
Pros: light and stateless storage mechanism over. fast for processing data due to its ability to return queries instantly.
Cons: can be tricky to integrate with the software to fully make it operational. but there is a lot of information to support it on blogs. “High performance with this powerful database”
Pros: This software has the facility to balance all the security burdens which allows a better and more extensive storage of files, there is no license to pay, everything can be done quickly because all the data is connected and interlaced in each document.
Cons: The only bad thing is that MongoDB uses all the RAM and fills the browser's cache and always crashes with the concurrency of the server. “easy and great database nosql”
Pros: it supports CRUD operations and is very well documented. It is very flexibile and i faced no diffuculty in moving from rdbms to nosql. It is very secure, supports scability and have high performance.
Cons: A well build GUI for query purpose can be made, because writing complex query is not easy and is a difficult task. Handling multiple cluster is complex and installation process is not easy. “Fast , reliable db witha great TCO”
Pros: MongoDB is an awesome DB server , flexible modern and with a fast learning curve. I love when I've to work with it and also it's compelmentary tool like Compass are smart and easy to be used. Every time i work with traditional DBs I wish to use Mongo and Compass again !
Cons: Probably with large data set, over 100gb you should choose other DBs to prevent performance problem “Good for some complex database relation”
Overall: Best for relational database very easy to write queries.
Pros: This is same as other tool for database same query you can write but because of its unique data structure its very fast and efficient in data retrial.
Cons: As its very fast in execution but its does not support join as the result some time it will require large amount of memory to store the data. “User-friendly database”
Pros: When creating my first app I used MongoDB to store my NoSQL database and it was very easy to use and looked great!
Cons: Connecting with the server was sometimes not efficient. “Useful and project friendly”
Overall: I am able to create an application that requires a database without complications.
Pros: This is able to manage an entire application for use by commercial to non commercial people that need a NoSQL database to be used.
Cons: There are no user interfaces for the management of databases which can be an innovative way of managing a database outside your application without creating your own software to do this. “The best no sql database I have used.”
Overall: Good NoSql platform allowing fast flexible queries.
Pros: I am impressed by the scalability and flexibility of queries. This is mostly a comparison to sql as this is my database background. The query performance also seems to be a step up.
Cons: If you're background is sql, then it requires a bit of mind shift to get used to the lack of relational models. “MongoDB is a fast DBMS”
Pros: MongoDB is an incredible database model. It doesn't have relation models (that might be a con for you) but this comes with super fast query times
Cons: As I said above, MongoDB doesn't provide relations for your object, that might look like a con for some of you. But as soon as you model your object wisely you won't need this lack, and have lower query times instead “Good document based Database!”
Overall: I used MongoDB in one of my project which was based on Yelp data set. The project was about providing Topic Modelling on Yelp Dataset. The processed data was saved in MongoDB. MongoDB is easy to use and provide good support for a lot of languages.
Pros: Easy to use. “mongo db”
Pros: very good and attractive database and is very usefull for database engineers
Cons: very heavy and i had faced some problems although i didn't enough use it “This software has an incredible database”
Pros: It has a large storage that allows the user to view each content and easily save each document, with different tools designed for data analysis and evaluations.
Cons: It is not so easy to use, it requires a high understanding of technology for good handling, but usually I have not had any problems with this software. “Database management using javascript”
Pros: You do not have have organize your data SQL-style with tables to represent various entities. It makes the development process that much quicker
Cons: It doesn't come with some of the popular hosting sites like Godaddy and Hostgator. You are forced to set it up as an external service. “Excellent NoSQL document store”
Pros: MongoDB's NoSQL structure means that developers don't have to pre-define the schema, making it flexible to handle complex data types.
Cons: Many teams and applications don't actually need a NoSQL DB or document store. For most applications, relational databases are easier to operate. “Great way of storing data”
Pros: MongoDB makes it really easy to store data in a JSON like way. It is intuitive to set up and pick up for a new team.
Cons: On occasion, especially during setup, it can be difficult to self-resolve issues that come up and it is not always obvious where to look in the documentation. “Overall great noSQL solution for apps which would use a nosql backend”
Overall: Main benefits are the simple to set up noSQL interface. Tables and blobs are quite user friendly.
Pros: Easy to set up and use, and the nature of nosql is such that it is easy to generate the backend for any number of tasks.
Cons: Difficult to scale, in general it feels like SQL solutions tend to be easier to be used for large projects. “Best no-SQL DB”
Overall: Amazing write operation oriented no-SQL DB. working great for my organization. Querying is sometimes challenging with its aggregation, it's most suitable for production DB for applications. “Mongo review”
Overall: - I have used it in my office project it's great .
Pros: - easy to use because its based on NOSQL. - object oriented database with enrich features - more secure and reliable.
Cons: - it's Enterprise edition is very costly. - it's not popular as MYSQL I don't know what's the reason “Scalable and Very Powerful”
Pros: Mongo DB is very scalable and reliable and offers a large variety of features for NoSQL Database, It is fast and has many libraries tp make use of for complex operations.
Cons: MongoDB is not well documented and i have to use different blogs and websites to make use of MongoDB features. “Managing databases”
Pros: The product provides very easy to use the mechanism, the product is free and also well integrated with Jason structure.
Cons: The tool is great however, it is assuming that your database scale is medium or small, for big databases, slowness becomes an issue. “Great for beginners”
Overall: Very simple language to use but still delivers a large amount of power for complex analysis. Also is able to handle instantaneous queries over a larger amount of data. making better use of the hardware resources of the applications that require it.
Pros: This type of non-relational database is a very useful tool today, where the amount of data handled in the web services are very abundant and a better way to store and take advantage of resources is needed, we use mongoDb, with its noSQL proposal takes better advantage of resources, since no paid licenses are needed, this money is used for hardware power, the expansion is easier since the database should not be restructured, it will keep the files linearly, that the escalation is horizontal and the load is distributed across all the nodes, taking better advantage of the hardware performance making any application more scalable.
Cons: It has its weaknesses, but you must know when to use this technology and when to use relational database, there are no transactions so if you need to use it, you should simulate them in a certain way, if it is very required in your application it is better to use sql, either Joins is available, so you should make several queries to interact between the data, you must be careful with this and know what technology is better with the application that will be developed. 
“The de facto standard for document-based NoSQL databases”
Overall: MongoDB has made it very easy to rapidly develop and deploy applications that require a document-store based NoSQL database solution.
Pros: MongoDB is the most widespread solution available in terms of a NoSQL database that manages data as a document store. It provides all the best features a NoSQL database should have to offer: clean and easy setup, simple syntax, as well as advanced features such as map-reduce and scaling capabilities. The BSON document type maps beautifully with the JavaScript stack, making it simple to wire up an application with a nodejs backend and any popular frontend JavaScript framework.
Cons: MongoDB can be hard to set up to support auto-scaling environments, and the best provisioned hosting options are quite expensive. Overall: For non-relational data storage, you really cannot beat MongoDB.
Pros: It's incredibly flexible and performant. With rich documents you can keep data in just about any way that makes sense to you. When your data doesn't nicely fit into the relational database format you'll want to use MongoDB. They're constantly developing the database and each version brings more features and better ways of doing things. The aggregation features allow for complex heavy queries to be run very quickly.
Cons: It can be a bit complicated to start with and writing aggregations without a great tool to help can be pretty tricky. Some of the features in the earlier versions are slightly limited and miss core requirements like 'join' style queries. “Great Product!”
Overall: Great Experience!
Pros: The ease of handling a vast amount of data without crashing the system.
Cons: The scripting language has a sharp learning curve in the begging, but once you learn the language it isn't so bad.“Fast”
Pros: The important I love about mongodb is the time required to shape an idea into reality, it's very quick compared to other solutions. The performance are good as well, making it a good choice for big data use cases.  “Best alternative to SQL”
Pros: It is very powerful software which helps in fast and efficient analysis of complex datasets. Queries performed are fast on mongodb as compared to traditional tools. It does scale very well and supports Nosql.
Cons: Configuration setting should be done with utmost care because sometimes wrong setting results in data loss and data becoming corrupt. Some error messages doesn't sense anything. “Great value for money but bad long term use”
Overall: Never listen to the proponents -- Mongo is NOT web scale. With long standing and known issues relating to quorem, locking, single thread replication, and data management, Mongo is only a good choice for certain document manage storage systems “NoSQL based database with easy familiar query pattern”
Overall: Easier NoSQL database
Pros: The database could handle large dataset and stored as json. The database is very similar to other traditional database making it easier to learn, however has very modern query designs, can be integrated for realtime applications. And most of all it is open source.
Cons: The database running as service takes lots of system memory. The database is in early stage of development so, the database is not efficient than the other stable ones.  “MongoDB”
Pros: A lot easier to use compared to SQL Databases
Cons: It`s not so fast compared to SQL like databases “Great!, is a fantastic way to store my data, without a relational sgbd”
Pros: I really liked the fact that I could easily manage the data of my organization and manipulate it in a non-relational way. It is very useful when you need to save data but not exactly need to establish a rigid relational scheme. It also has a lot of documentation which helps a lot to adapt to it.
Cons: What I liked the least were the initial configuration aspects, which are easy to understand for people with a lot of experience but which nevertheless turns out to be somewhat unfriendly for beginners. “An honest MongoDB review”
Pros: 1 Easy replication setup 2 It's a document store 3 Great Enterprise package
Cons: 1 SDK support is quite glitchy 2 Collection models does not update “Best solution for NoSQL database”
Pros: Easy to use because of schema-less feature. Data retrieving is very fast. Powerful Aggregate functions.
Cons: Take higher storage size.need more documentations. “Good nosql db”
Overall: Used for many schemaless systems at work
Pros: Easy to use Plugins are awesome Really helpful community Works really well with Nodejs Mongoose
Cons: Can be hard to get started sometimes .

Its performance is mainly based on two key value that is design and scale out. MongoDB uses the document as the basic storage unit. In the relational model, the data will be stored in an individual table. In document model, they are saved as one document and its performance is much faster compared to relational query.It also provides ACID properties at the document level as in the case of relational databases.It supports replica sets; in other words, a failover mechanism is automatically handled. If the primary server goes down, the secondary server becomes the primary automatically, without any human intervention.MongoDB can be a cost effective solution because improves flexibility and reduces cost on hardware and storage. If you have an application that performs lots of writes, Mongo isn't a great solution from my humble opinion. As the data size grows, my team has applied TokuMx to speed up Mongo."

"51" ""
"52" "Replication"
"53" "MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets.[9] A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data. Each replica set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time. All writes and reads are done on the primary replica by default. Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically conducts an election process to determine which secondary should become the primary. Secondaries can optionally serve read operations, but that data is only eventually consistent by default."
"54" ""
"55" "Load balancing[10]"
"56" "MongoDB scales horizontally using sharding. The user chooses a shard key, which determines how the data in a collection will be distributed. The data is split into ranges (based on the shard key) and distributed across multiple shards. (A shard is a master with one or more slaves.). Alternatively, the shard key can be hashed to map to a shard <U+653C><U+3E32>�<U+393C><U+3E33> enabling an even data distribution."
"57" ""
"58" "MongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load or duplicating data to keep the system up and running in case of hardware failure."
"59" ""
"60" "File storage"
"61" "MongoDB can be used as a file system, called GridFS, with load balancing and data replication features over multiple machines for storing files."

"63" "This function, called grid file system,[11] is included with MongoDB drivers. MongoDB exposes functions for file manipulation and content to developers. GridFS can be accessed using mongofiles utility or plugins for Nginx[12] and lighttpd.[13] GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, and stores each of those chunks as a separate document.[14]"

"65" "Aggregation"
"66" "MapReduce can be used for batch processing of data and aggregation operations."

"68" "The aggregation framework enables users to obtain the kind of results for which the SQL GROUP BY clause is used. Aggregation operators can be strung together to form a pipeline <U+653C><U+3E32>�<U+393C><U+3E33> analogous to Unix pipes. The aggregation framework includes the $lookup operator which can join documents from multiple documents, as well as statistical operators such as standard deviation.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?Schema-less can sometimes bite you if you are unable or unwilling to validate your data at the application level before storing in Mongo.

Rather than re-work relationships and foreign keys in traditional RDBMS, Mongo means we are only having to make our changes in code. The database \"just works\" with our changes(assuming those changes are sane). To sum it up, Mongo lets development progress as fast as possible, with no blocking to refactor schema. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?Schema-less can sometimes bite you if you are unable or unwilling to validate your data at the application level before storing in Mongo. This is solved by writing stored functions(in JS) in Mongo, which can leave something to be desired. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Show MoreRecommendations to others considering the product:Don't go NoSQL because it's the shiny object of the moment.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We're saving time(ie money) with Mongo. When a stored document needs to contain not only 'foo' and 'bar', but an additional 5 (or 5000) fields, it \"just works\".

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?Mongo gives you some aspects of a relational database, allowing the user to do things (like joins through relationship queries) in a way.   This is a double-edged sword as applying relational techniques to a object store will just cause pain and suffering.   Since most people think in relational databases, there is a lot of relational techniques on Mongo, and thus a lot of pain and suffering."

What else can you ask for in a database?\"What do you like best?MongoDB hits a sweet spot with requirements call for rapidly developing an application that needs to be fast, scaleable, highly tolerant of change, and has variable data needs.  Its document oriented approach opens up possibilities for streamlining application architecture that cannot be easily be achieved with relational databases and even other NoSQL solutions like key/value stores. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?Getting up and running with MongoDB is extremely easy - download and run.  Its ability to scale to huge levels is impressive.  But the configuration of a large cluster is not for the faint of heart, as it can become extremely complicated to keep track of hundreds of shards and replicas.   However, the MongoDB team is working to solve this issue.  The new deployment and management features of the new release of their MMS service makes the task relatively simple.
