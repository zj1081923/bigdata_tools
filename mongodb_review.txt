"51" ""
"52" "Replication"
"53" "MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets.[9] A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data. Each replica set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time. All writes and reads are done on the primary replica by default. Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically conducts an election process to determine which secondary should become the primary. Secondaries can optionally serve read operations, but that data is only eventually consistent by default."
"54" ""
"55" "Load balancing[10]"
"56" "MongoDB scales horizontally using sharding. The user chooses a shard key, which determines how the data in a collection will be distributed. The data is split into ranges (based on the shard key) and distributed across multiple shards. (A shard is a master with one or more slaves.). Alternatively, the shard key can be hashed to map to a shard <U+653C><U+3E32>€<U+393C><U+3E33> enabling an even data distribution."

GridFS can be accessed using mongofiles utility or plugins for Nginx[12] and lighttpd.[13] GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, and stores each of those chunks as a separate document.[14]"

Also; you can bring a novice up to speed to work with MongoDB queries relatively quickly.  Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?Flexibility can be a double edged sword.

Rather than re-work relationships and foreign keys in traditional RDBMS, Mongo means we are only having to make our changes in code. The database \"just works\" with our changes(assuming those changes are sane). To sum it up, Mongo lets development progress as fast as possible, with no blocking to refactor schema. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?Schema-less can sometimes bite you if you are unable or unwilling to validate your data at the application level before storing in Mongo. This is solved by writing stored functions(in JS) in Mongo, which can leave something to be desired. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Show MoreRecommendations to others considering the product:Don't go NoSQL because it's the shiny object of the moment. To get the most of out Mongo, try to get yourself and your developers out of the relational data mindset - while you may be able to find similarities and overlap in RDBMS and Mongo, trying to implement it in that fashion will (almost) always end in tears. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We're saving time(ie money) with Mongo. When a stored document needs to contain not only 'foo' and 'bar', but an additional 5 (or 5000) fields, it \"just works\". The problem in the past was schema factoring, and the time spent designing schema - Mongo solved those for us.

The binary code base is light and efficient. With new 3.0 release, write lock is at collection level which is big improvement from previous releases. MongoDB can scale horizontally (form multiple nodes cluster) with minimal effort. For database users want the best performance possible, one can setup a large cluster with many low cost computers or cloud servers so whole or majority part of database is in Memory."
"276" "* MongoDB is well protected against hardware failure and data center failure.  Unlike older generation of relational database that uses backup for hardware failure and disaster recovery. MongoDB uses online replication. MongoDB replication is the default and recommended installation  that creates multiple copy of data across different servers. With careful planning, MongoDB user can have online copies of database files on different storage array or different data center to prevent single point of failure and data loss. Because of the distributed architecture, MongoDB can withstand one or more nodes failure without impact its availability. "

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?* MongoDB is one of very first new nosql databases on the market. It is important to understand it is not a ACID compliant database. What that means is it is not transaction safe beyond the document level (roughly equivalent to a row in relational database). It is the tradeoff for scalability and durability and it is by design according to  MongoDB developer.

Rather than re-work relationships and foreign keys in traditional RDBMS, Mongo means we are only having to make our changes in code. The database \"just works\" with our changes(assuming those changes are sane). To sum it up, Mongo lets development progress as fast as possible, with no blocking to refactor schema. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike?Schema-less can sometimes bite you if you are unable or unwilling to validate your data at the application level before storing in Mongo. This is solved by writing stored functions(in JS) in Mongo, which can leave something to be desired. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Show MoreRecommendations to others considering the product:Don't go NoSQL because it's the shiny object of the moment. To get the most of out Mongo, try to get yourself and your developers out of the relational data mindset - while you may be able to find similarities and overlap in RDBMS and Mongo, trying to implement it in that fashion will (almost) always end in tears. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We're saving time(ie money) with Mongo. When a stored document needs to contain not only 'foo' and 'bar', but an additional 5 (or 5000) fields, it \"just works\".
